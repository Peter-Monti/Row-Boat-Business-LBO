I wanted to get an idea of what my Boat Business would be worth, in the event of a sale. 
The first tab is an over view of my start up costs and my 3 months worth of sales. 
I took those 3 month sales and projected them out over a full year, making to account for low sales in certain months. 
The second tab consist of my 3 financial statements, I even discounted my equipment using Single Line Depreciation. 
In my final tab I created an LBO in the event of an acquisition. 
I used a conservative growth rate of 7%, this growth rate represents a worker putting in several more hours a week. Its very possible to grow at 7% a year as, I was only running the business part time and left a-lot of growth.
After finishing the model I arrived at a 21% IRR and a Moic of 2.64.
